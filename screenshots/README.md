## How to Capture Screenshots

### Recommended Size
- Width: 1200-1920px
- Format: PNG or JPG
- Quality: High (minimize compression for text clarity)

### What to Capture
- **Dashboard**: Full page view showing multiple machine cards, summary stats at top, and shift selector
- **Machines**: Table view with a few sample machines showing status, production, and efficiency
- **Reports**: Overview tab showing machine history expanded for one machine, and downtime summary table
- **Production Tab**: Form at top for creating stats, and table below with recent entries
- **Dark Mode**: Any page (dashboard recommended) in dark theme

### Tips
- Use real or realistic sample data
- Capture with browser dev tools at 1280x720 or larger
- Use Chrome's device toolbar (F12 → Toggle device toolbar) for consistent sizing
- Hide sensitive information if needed
- Show a variety of machine statuses (running, idle, down, maintenance)

### Tools
- **Chrome DevTools**: F12 → Screenshot (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Capture screenshot")
- **Snipping Tool** (Windows): Built-in screenshot tool
- **Snagit** or **Lightshot**: Third-party tools for more control

Once you add the images, the main README.md will automatically display them!
